# Gemini-Powered Multi-PDF Chatbot

This application allows users to upload and interact with multiple PDF documents through a conversational interface. It uses **Google Gemini 1.5** for intelligent response generation and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide page-specific answers based on the uploaded content. If a user query falls outside the scope of the uploaded documents, the app seamlessly falls back to Geminiâ€™s general knowledge.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Parsing**: The app reads and extracts text from uploaded PDFs using `PyMuPDF` and applies OCR (via `pytesseract`) where necessary.
2. **Chunking & Embedding**: Extracted content is chunked and embedded using `thenlper/gte-small` via HuggingFace.
3. **Vector Store**: Chunks are stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient similarity search.
4. **Query Handling**:
   - If relevant content is found: Gemini generates an answer referencing the matched chunk(s) and their page numbers.
   - If not: Gemini responds using its general knowledge.
5. **Streaming Chat Interface**: Answers are displayed through a Streamlit interface with persistent session chat history.
